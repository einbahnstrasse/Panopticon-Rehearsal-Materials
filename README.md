2. Use with a preferred DAW (e.g. Logic, Ableton Live, Reaper, etc.). Alternatively, iTunes or a similar app may be used, but is less convenient. 
3. Drag-and-drop individual click tracks into your DAW. Ideal if you're woodshedding one of the parts. 

#### ADVANCED USE
1. Place a stack of click tracks audio files in your DAW on multiple simultaneous tracks, i.e. if rehearsing multiple parts. 
2. Mute/unmute individual tracks to hear individual clicks and cues for each part. 
3. If your DAW supports 'warping' (e.g. Ableton Live) you can 'warp' the audio for these tracks, speeding them up or slow them down to a preferred rehearsal tempo.
